# Exploding Atoms

Exploding Atoms was created as a small credit project three years ago.

The Exploding Atoms program consists of [documentation](documentation.pdf) and the Exploding Atoms game itself, which is
a logic game whose rules are described in the user section of the documentation. This game is primarily designed for two
players, but one of the two players can be replaced by a computer player, so it is possible to play without a human
opponent.

The program itself is controlled by the user through graphical elements created using a set of pygame modules in Python.

## Getting Started

It is possible to run an already compiled version of [Exploding Atoms](ExplodingAtoms.exe).
